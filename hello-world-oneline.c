/*

The above is perfectly fine.  All the code on one line.  
Line and spaces are not what give C code it's structure.
It is the semicolon line terminators and brackets {} that give it structure.

Spaces, indentation, lines are source code formatting for US.  The compiler doesn't care.

Compare this to Python...Spaces, indentation, and lines ARE what give Python code structure.
